 * Decouples the LiteRT loading layer from packaging. Today every model is an [Asset] bundled in the
 * APK; a model delivered via Play Asset Delivery (AI Pack) or a self-hosted download instead resolves
 * to a [File] under the app's storage. The accelerator/NPU compile path is identical for both — only
 * the byte source differs (asset mmap vs. file mmap), so the loading layer threads a [ModelSource]
 * rather than a bare asset path.
 *
 * The seam that decides Asset vs. File (and triggers an asset-pack/download fetch when needed) is
 * [ModelSourceResolver]: a config carrying a [File] source is loaded straight from disk.
