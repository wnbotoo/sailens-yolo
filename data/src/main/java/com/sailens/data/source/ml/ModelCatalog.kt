/**
 * The single place that maps a logical model — its [ModelType] and the accelerator it is intended to
 * run on — to a physical [ModelSource]. Nothing else (providers, the loading layer, the runtime
 * profile) needs a model's file name; they refer to a model by `(type, accelerator)`.
 *
 * No model weights ship with this repository: the app is bring-your-own-model. Drop graphs that
 * satisfy the contract in `docs/models.md` at the asset paths below and the pipeline picks them up
 * — nothing else needs to change, because shape, layout, dtype and quantization are all read back
 * from the TFLite metadata at load time. Every `.tflite` under `data/src/main/assets` is git-ignored,
 * so a local working copy can carry weights without them ever entering a commit. With no weights
 * present, loading fails at init and surfaces as a start-analysis error.
 *
 * Vision models are expected to run on the GPU. Requesting NPU for any vision type is unsupported
 * here (throws) — the NPU is reserved for the future VLM path (see VlmModelConfig /
 * SailensRuntimeProfile ultra tier). Prefer NHWC graphs: NCHW exports with a float32 I/O wrapper
 * cost a per-frame host transpose and fragment on the GPU/NPU delegates.
 *
 * [ModelSourceResolver] wraps this catalog today. When model download lands, another resolver can
 * still use this as the bundled [Asset] fallback and upgrade to a downloaded [ModelSource.File].
